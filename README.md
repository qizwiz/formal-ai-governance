# Formal AI Governance Framework

A mathematically-rigorous framework for AI governance based on formal verification principles, building on contributions to CrewAI and LangChain.

## 🚀 Overview

This framework provides **mathematical guarantees** for AI agent behavior through formal verification using proof assistants. Unlike traditional testing-based approaches, this provides **provable safety properties** rather than empirical validation.

## 🔧 Key Components

### 1. Hierarchy Management
- **Capability-based organization** where higher-capability agents supervise lower-capability ones
- **Proven decision routing algorithms** with correctness guarantees
- **Formal validity preservation** ensuring hierarchies remain stable

### 2. Responsibility and Accountability
- **Mathematical responsibility assignment** based on hierarchy distance and outcomes
- **Proven accountability tracking** with formal guarantees
- **Transparent decision logging** with clear attribution paths

### 3. Citizenship Behaviors
- **Ethical rule compliance** with formal verification
- **Community contribution** metrics and incentives
- **Adaptive learning** while maintaining core principles

## 📊 Technical Achievements

### Formal Verification Components
- **Mathematical specifications** with proven properties
- **Algorithmic implementations** with correctness guarantees
- **System integration** with stability proofs

### Proven Properties
- ✅ Hierarchy validity preservation
